Lab 3.1 - Recursion
===================

1. Recursively find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 5.

2. Write a recursive program that prints a message n times.

3. Write a recursive program that counts down from 10 to 1.
   Sample run:

        10 seconds left!
        9 seconds left!
        ...
        1 second left!
        BANG!

4. Recursively find the value of exponent `e`, where
   `e = 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! ... + 1/n!`, and where `n` is input by user.

5. Write a recursive method that takes an integer parameter, and continuously
   prints the integer and divides it by 10, until the integer becomes 0.

        Enter an integer: 5839270
        5839270
        583927
        58392
        5839
        583
        58
        5

6. Write a recursive method that takes a number,
   and prints the digits of the number in reversed order.

        Enter an integer: 5839270
        0 7 2 9 3 8 5
