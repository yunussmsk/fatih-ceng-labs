Lab 5.2 - String methods
========================

1. Pick a random word from a sentence and make it uppercase.

2. Split a sentence into its words. Display them in alphabetic order.

3. Read the full name of a person, and display its initials,
   and number of letters it contains.

4. Read a sentence from user, and capitalize its words.

5. Read a sentence, a word position, and a replacement word.
   Then, find and replace it. Sample run:

        Enter a sentence: I hope you had a wonderful weekend!
        Enter a position: 3
        The word at position 3 is: you
        Enter a word to replace it with: Denny
        I hope Denny had a wonderful weekend!

6. Write a program that reads a sentence and a word,
   finds the word in the sentence, and makes it uppercase.
   Your program will repeat this, as long as the user wants.

   Sample run:

        Enter a sentence: I hope you had a wonderful weekend!
        Enter a word: wonderful
        Output: I hope you had a WONDERFUL weekend!
        Do you want to continue [yes/no]? yes

   Make it case-insensitive: Both "you" and "You" should replace "you"

        Enter a sentence: I hope you had a wonderful weekend and you enjoyed the weather!
        Enter a word: You
        Output: I hope YOU had a wonderful weekend and YOU enjoyed the weather!
        Do you want to continue [yes/no]? No
        Good bye!
